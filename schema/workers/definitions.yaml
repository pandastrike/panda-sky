    memorySize:
      description: >
        The Lambda memory allocation in MB.  Larger values also get more network throughput and CPU horsepower, as well as superior cold-start behavior, but the specifics on that are left murky by AWS docs. Minimum value is 128, and it must be specified as multiples of 64.  Sky defaults to 256.

    managedPolicies:
      description: >
        An array of ARNs to IAM Role policies managed by AWS.  You can include them to give the partition access to a given resource.

vault:
  description: |
    An array of names mapping to secrets from AWS SecretsManager.

    DO NOT PUT THE SECRET VALUES IN THIS FIELD!!

  type: array
  items:
    type: string

mixins:
  description: >
    This is an array of names assigned to Sky mixin configuration declared at the environment level.  Listing names here grants the worker permission to relevant resources via the policy exposed in the mixin.
  type: array
  items:
    type: string

schedule:
  description: >
    Specifies a scheduled invocation for this worker. You may specify this schedule as a fixed rate, or as a Cron expression.  Currently, there is no validation of the Cron expression, so consider it an expert feature.
