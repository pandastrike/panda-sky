      description: >
        When Lambdas are integrated with a VPC, they for ENIs to reach the resources within.  By default, CloudFormation waits for these connections to be drained before deleting the Lambdas during 'sky delete' and 'sky publish' (update) operations.  While this is sometimes good practice, it takes around 40 minutes to complete.  Setting this value to true ignores connection draining consideraitons and moves to complete the requested operation as quickly as possible.

            Setting this value to 0 gives you a custom domain with TLS
            termination, but no caching. This is a promising configuraiton
            option for staging environments.

            Sets the extent to which content is cached on CloudFront edge

            throughout the world, you can lower your expenses at the cost of
            less coverage.  See https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/ for
            a current description of what comes with each price class.

            When this value is omitted, Sky defaults to 100, which is cheapest,
            but comes with the smallest coverage area.

        headers:
          description: >
            This sets the list of headers forwarded and cached by the CloudFront
            distribution. Omitting this field will cause Sky to forward and
            cache the *default* headers.

            The *default* headers are: Accept, Accept-Charset, Accept-Datetime,
            Accept-Language, Access-Control-Request-Headers,
            Access-Control-Request-Method, Authorization, Origin, Referer

            Host is notably absent from those default headers.  When using
            Server Name Indentification in CloudFront, Gateway relies on that
            by default to verify the connection.  The usage of the Host header
            causes Gateway to issue a 403 response, baring special
            configuration.

            You may specify an empty array, [].  In this case Sky will set no
            headers.  This will forward the default headers, BUT NOT CACHE
            BASED ON THEM.

            You may specify a wildcard, [*], which forwards ALL headers.
            But in this case, CloudFront cannot leverage caching nor accept
            additional, specific headers to cache.
