    template:
      description: >
        The optionally templatized URL for a resource.  Sky uses the RFC standard for URI templating, with additional limits.

        For the path section of the URL, use the simple string notation, {...},  to specify a *single* variable name. More complex uses here are disallowed by Gateway.  See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570#section-3.2.2

        For the querystring section of the URL, you may use the full RFC  notation for querystring templating, {?...}. The Sky API accepts and parses any querystring parameters in Gateway, but will use this template section to validate incoming parameters in the dispatcher code of "panda-sky-helpers". See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570#section-3.2.8

        Example: "/person/{key}{?age,gender}"
      type: string
      # TODO: Come up with valid and useful regex here.

        Keys are arbitrary, but will usually represent the logical name of a
        request handling function.
