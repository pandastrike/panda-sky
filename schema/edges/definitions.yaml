    memorySize:
      description: >
        The Lambda memory allocation in MB.  Larger values also get more network throughput and CPU horsepower, as well as superior cold-start behavior, but the specifics on that are left murky by AWS docs. Minimum value is 128, and it must be specified as multiples of 64.  Sky defaults to 256. This value is ignored for viewer-request and viewer-response lambdas as they are restricted to 128 exclusively.
